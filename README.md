I wrote these modules to cut down on boilerplate in my
other python scripts. In my python repo you'll find a few
scripts that interact with browsers and GDrive so I
figured that putting the most common things I do with each
inside of modules I wrote myself was a far better use of
my time than writing the same lines over and over again
every time I want to do something in python with a
web browser or GDrive.


Why am I writing my own module when PyDrive exists?
It's simple really. I don't like the way they handle
the credentials.json
